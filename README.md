# Autoencoder for ATLAS

An autoencoder neural network was used to compress the four-momentum of a sample of simulated particles from 4 to 3 variables.

The dataset and the base code was provided by the maintainers of [the ATLAS project](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/gsoc/projects/2020/project_ATLAS.html) at CERN. This was performed as an evaluation task for Google Summer of Code 2021.

All operations were performed in a single jupyter notebook.
